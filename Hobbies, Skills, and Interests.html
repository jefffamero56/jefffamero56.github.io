			<h3>Skills:</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>VB.NET</b> - I learnt the programming language <b>VB.net</b> in my first stint in the University, and I used it to create my first applications. Throughout the years, even if I wasn't doing it professionally, I made sure I still had the newest abilities since I enjoy doing it. In the future, I want to get a <i>certification</i> for it.</p>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>VBA</b> - In <i>2018</i>, while working as a government clerk, I learned the language by watching tutorials on YouTube and searching the internet for the syntax. And since the language is very similar to <b>VB.net</b>, I learned it with little effort. I was able to develop a <i>system for creating reports</i> that counts the diseases that are encoded in a month and returns the top 25. Even though it wasn't required of me, I continued to do it because I enjoy it.  In a previous job, I also developed a <i>hospital admissions encoder system</i> that allows the user to enter patient information once and have it automatically encoded into three different record systems: <i>Admissions, Emergency room, and clinical case records.</i> Additionally, the system will verify that the information encoded is legitimate. For instance, it will alert the user if the birthday or age entered do not match, or if the name contains typographical errors like numbers or special characters. I've also used VBA to develop additional systems, including an automatic backup system that creates a new copy of the file at exactly 11pm everyday, it creates a different copy every single time, so for example if the file was accidentally modified on 10<sup>th</sup> of February, We can copy the 9<sup>th</sup> of February file, and so on. Another program that I created is a pass verification system for Patient Watchers, which keep a track of Watcherâ€™s ID numbers within the hospital.</p>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>Android Studio(Kotlin)</b> - I'm still learning the programming language <b>Android Studio (Kotlin)</b> in <i>Udemy.com</i>, and this is the kind of Programmer I want to become after I graduate from the University. Using the aforementioned IDE, I made an <i>MDAS calculator</i>, which I intend to post on the Google Play Store as a component of my portfolio once I graduate. I'm currently working on an Android alarm clock system that I aim to publish and hopefully make money off of. I also intend to develop an offline video player and an offline music player for Android. When my skills of this language improve, I also want to work on large projects.</p>
			</ul>



			<h3>Hobbies:</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>Playing video games</b> on computers and mobile devices: In my free time, I enjoy playing games like <i>Clash Royale and Mobile Legends.</i> Gatotkaca and Bruno are two of my favorite characters. Together with other friends I met in the game, I formed our squad, the <i>Silent Assassins.</i> In addition, I like to play PC games like <i>Football Manager 2023, FIFA 22,  Assassin's Creed, NBA 2k23, and Red Alert 2.</i> Other games I like to play are <i>Generals: Zero Hour, Battle Realms, and Generals: Alert 2.</i></p>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>Sports Watching:</b> When I have the time, I also enjoy watching volleyball, basketball, and soccer at home. The <i>Miami Heat</i> of the NBA, <i>FC Barcelona</i>, and the <i>UE Red Warriors</i> are a few of my favorite teams. I occasionally play basketball when my friends ask me to, but I've gained weight over the years, so I'm not as energetic as I once was. :)</p>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>Programming:</b> This is something I really want to accomplish since I get excited when I see my codes work. During my days off from school, I make sure to set out three hours for schoolwork or code practice. I spend an hour studying programming as soon as I get up, an additional hour at approximately 1 pm, and an additional hour at approximately 7 pm. To make sure I give the task exactly an hour, I set a timer.</p>
			</ul>



			<h3>Interests:</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>Watching Asian Dramas:</b> I enjoy watching Asian dramas when I'm not practicing programming or playing computer games. I enjoyed watching shows like <i>Alice in Borderland, Frog Prince, Strong Woman Do Bong Soon, Strong Girl Nam Soon, and Crash Landing on You.</i> only to mention a few.</p>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>Study Game development:</b> Since playing video games on the computer is one of my favorite pastimes. When I discovered that I can come back to School and have a chance to pursue a programming career, learning about game creation has been one of my goals. I want to master Unity engine and C<sup>#</sup> programming since, according to Google, 75% of games made today are made with Unity, and I anticipate that there will be a lot of jobs available for those who use that engine. I also want to learn how to use the Unreal Engine with C<sup>++</sup> because I think the graphics made with that engine are amazing and realistic-looking. But for now, those are all just plans. My primary focus is on learning Android Studio and Kotlin programming language because I believe it will make it easier for me to find employment after I graduate.</p>
			<li><p style = "text-align:justify;font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;"><b>Computer hardware:</b> Computer hardware is something else that interests me. I make an effort to stay current with the newest developments in computer hardware, such as <i>processor, RAM, GPU, motherboard, and other components.</i> I watch YouTube videos on how to fix various computer issues, like BSODs. Even if I havenâ€™t encountered them yet. ðŸ˜Š </p>
